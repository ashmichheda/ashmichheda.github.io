If i were to define myself in one word, I'd say Curious!

I am a first year Masters student in Computer Science at [Arizona State University](https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/graduate-computer-science/). <br/>
I am a passionate Software Developer diving in the field of Machine Learning. Primarily, my interests lie in Machine Learning, Software Engineering and designing large-scale systems.

I have 3 years of experience in Software Engineering at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) - developing systems for [J.P. Morgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorganchase.com) client, in the Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) segment. I've worked on different projects using Java J2EE technologies, from building web dashboards, hackathon website and automation framework. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering](https://www.somaiya.edu/kjsce) in 2016.

Apart from work - Sports is an integral part of my life. I've been playing Lawn Tennis since the age of 12 and have won couple of inter-college national level tournaments. A big Rafa and Serena fan! During my free time - I enjoy solving puzzles, do some Competitive Programming and Open Source contributions!
