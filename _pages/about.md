I am currently working at Accenture as a Software Engineer. My work specifically involves developing, maintiaing, desigining and testing applications for U.S. based Multinational Investment banking client. During my free time, I enjoy solving puzzles, doing Competitive Programming and try to do open source contributions.

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering](https://www.somaiya.edu/kjsce) in the year 2016 and proceeded my professional career at Accenture.
