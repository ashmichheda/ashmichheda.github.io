If i were to define myself in one word, I'd say Curious!<br/><br/>
On a professional front, I am working at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) as a Software Engineer. My work specifically involves developing applications using Java J2EE technologies for U.S. based Multinational Investment banking client. During my free time, I enjoy solving puzzles, do some Competitive Programming and contribute to open source projects!

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering](https://www.somaiya.edu/kjsce) in the year 2016 and proceeded my professional career at Accenture.
