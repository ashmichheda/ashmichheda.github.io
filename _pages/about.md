If I were to define myself in one word, I'd say Curious!

I am a second year Masters student in Computer Science at the [Arizona State University](https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/graduate-computer-science/). <br/>
Currently I am interning at [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) with the Platform Charts Team. 
Primarily, my interests lie in Machine Learning, Software Engineering and large-scale system design.

Prior to joining ASU, I worked for 3 years at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) as a Software Engineer - developing systems for [J.P. Morgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorganchase.com). I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering](https://www.somaiya.edu/kjsce) in 2016.

Apart from work - Sports is an integral part of my life. I've been playing Lawn Tennis since the age of 12 and have won couple of inter-college national level tournaments. A big Rafa and Serena fan! During my free time - I enjoy solving puzzles, do some Competitive Programming and Open Source contributions!
