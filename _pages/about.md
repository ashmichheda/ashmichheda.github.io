If i were to define myself in one word, I'd say Curious!

I am a passionate Software Developer diving in the field of Machine Learning. Primarily, my interests lie in Machine Learning, Software Engineering and designing large-scale systems.

I've worked for 3 years at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) as a Software Engineer for [J.P. Morgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorganchase.com) client, in the Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) segment. I've worked on multiple projects using technologies such as Java, Ember JS, Spring MVC and JavaScript. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering](https://www.somaiya.edu/kjsce) in 2016.

Sports is an integral part of my life. I've been playing Lawn Tennis since the age of 12 and have won couple of inter-college national level tournaments. A big Rafa and Serena fan! During my free time - I enjoy solving puzzles, do some Competitive Programming and contribute to open source projects!
